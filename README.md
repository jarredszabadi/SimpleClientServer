SimpleClientServer
==================

A very simple udp client/server program in which the server receives data, converts the text into UPPER CASE, and then returns that data to the client


The client is threaded so it can send and receive concurrently

To run:
1) Run the UDPServer first
2) Run the UDPClient second
3) Type a sentence in the UDPClient terminal window and press enter




*If you run any of these files through the command line you will be required to compile the code first. 
For exampe: to run the UDPClient through the command line you would do the following.


1) cd </path/to/directory>
2) javac UDPClient.java
3) java UDPClient


to run the UDPServer through the command line you would replace 'UDPClient.java' with UDPServer.java in step 2)
